# Deepfake Detection System

This project aims to build a deep learning model to detect AI-generated fake videos and images (deepfakes). With the rise of misinformation, such a system is crucial for maintaining digital integrity.

## Project Plan

1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize the repository and project structure.
2.  **Dataset Research & Preparation**: Find and preprocess a suitable dataset for training. We will start with the [Deepfake Detection Dataset from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/saakshigupta/deepfake-detection-dataset-v3).
3.  **Model Development**:
    *   Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images and video frames.
    *   Train the model on the chosen dataset.
    *   Evaluate and iterate on the model to improve its accuracy.
4.  **Real-time Detection (Future Goal)**: Explore methods to implement real-time detection capabilities.
5.  **Browser Extension (Future Goal)**: Package the model into a browser extension for use on social media platforms.

## Getting Started

To begin, you can open the `1_Data_Exploration.ipynb` notebook to see how the data is loaded and visualized.
